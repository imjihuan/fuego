About Fuego
===========

Fuego is a test system specifically designed for embedded Linux
testing. It supports automated testing of embedded targets from
a host system, as it's primary method of test execution.

The quick introduction to Fuego is that it consists of a host/target
script engine and over 100 pre-packaged tests. These are installed
in a docker container along with a Jenkins web interface and
job control system, ready for out-of-the-box Continuous Integration
testing of your embedded Linux project.

The ideas is that in the simplest case, you just add your board,
a toolchain, and go!
