Fuego Quickstart Guide
======================

Running tests from Fuego on your hardware can be accomplished in a few
simple steps.

.. _quickstart overview:

Overview
========
Here is an overview of the steps:

1. install pre-requisite software
2. download the fuego repository
3. build your fuego container
4. start the container
5. access the interface
6. add your board to fuego
7. run a test

These steps are described below.

Install pre-requisite software
==============================
To retrieve the fuego software and create the docker image
for it, you need to have git and docker installed on your system.
On Ubuntu, try the following commands:::

  $ sudo apt-get install git
  $ sudo apt-get install docker.io

Download, build, start and access
=================================
To accomplish the first 6 steps, do the following from a Linux command
prompt:::

  $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/fuegotest/fuego.git
  $ cd fuego ; ./install.sh
  $ ./start.sh
  $ firefox http://localhost:8090/fuego

The third step (with ./install.sh) will take some time - about 45 minutes
on my machine.  This is the main step that is building the docker
container.

When you run the 'start.sh' script, the terminal
where this is run will be placed at a shell prompt, as the root user,
inside the docker container.  The container will run until you exit this
shell.  You should leave it running for the duration of your testing.

''NOTE: If you are experimenting with the unreleased version of Fuego
in the 'next' branch, then please replace the 'git clone' command in
the instructions above with these:::

  $ git clone -b next https://bitbucket.org/fuegotest/fuego.git
  $ git clone -b next https://bitbucket.org/fuegotest/fuego-core.git''

On the last step, to access the Fuego interface you can use any
browser - not just Firefox.  By default the Fuego interface runs on your
host machine, on port 8090, with URL path "/fuego".

In your browser, you should see a screen similar to the following:

[[image:fuego-1.1-jenkins-dashboard-new.png|width=900]]

We will now add items to Fuego (and this screen) so you can begin testing.


Add your board to fuego
=======================
To add your own board to Fuego, there are three main steps:

1. create a test directory on the target
2. create a board file (on the host)
3. add your board to the Jenkins interface

You can find detailed instructions for adding a board at:
[[Adding a board]]

However, here is a quick list of steps you can do to add
a your own board, and a sample 'docker' board to Fuego:

Create a test directory on your board
=====================================
Login to your board, and create a directory to use for testing:::

  $ ssh root@your_board
  <board>$ mkdir /home/a
  <board>$ exit


If not using ssh, use whatever method you normally use to
access the board.

Create board file
-----------------
Now, create your board file.
The board file resides in <fuego-dir>/fuego-ro/boards, and has a filename
with the name of the board, with the extension ".board".

Do the following:::
  $ cd fuego-ro/boards
  $ cp template-dev.board myboard.board
  $ vi myboard.board

Edit the variables in the board file to match your board.
Most variables can be left alone, but you will need
to change the IPADDR, PLATFORM and ARCHITECTURE variables,
and set the BOARD_TESTDIR to the directory
you just created above.

For other variables in the board file, or specifically to use
a different transport than SSH, see more complete instructions
at: [[Adding a board]]


Add boards to the Jenkins interface
-----------------------------------
Finally, add the board in the Jenkins interface.

In the Jenkins interface, boards are referred to as "Nodes".

At the container shell prompt, run the following command:
* (container prompt)$ ftc add-nodes myboard docker

This will add your board as a node, as well as a'docker' node in
the Jenkins interface.

Install a toolchain
===================
If you just wish to run experiment with Fuego, without installing your
own board, you can use the existing 'docker' board.  This will run the
tests inside the docker container on your host machine. This requires
little setup, and is intended to let people try Fuego to see how the
interface and tests work, without having to set up their own board.

If you are running an ARM board with a Debian-based distribution on it,
you can install the Debian ARM cross-compilers into the docker container
with the following command (inside the container):
* (container prompt)$ /fuego-ro/toolchains/install_armhf_toolchain.sh

If you are installing a some other kind of board (different
architecture, different root filesystem layout, or different shared
library set), you will need to install a toolchain for your board
inside the docker container.

Please follow the instructions at:
[[Adding a toolchain]] to do this.

Now select some tests
=====================
In order to execute tests using the Jenkins interface, you need to
create Jenkins "jobs" for them.  You can do this using the
'ftc add-jobs' command.

These commands are also executed at the shell prompt in the docker
container.

You can add jobs individually, or you can add a set of jobs all at
once based on something called a 'testplan'.  A testplan is a list
of Fuego tests with some options for each one.  You can see the
list of testplans in your system with the following command:
* (container prompt)$ ftc list-plans

To create a set of jobs for the 'docker' board on the system, do
the following:
* (container prompt)$ ftc add-jobs -b docker -p testplan_docker

To create a set of jobs for your own board (assuming you called
it 'myboard'), do the following:
* $ (container prompt)$ ftc add-jobs -b myboard -p testplan_smoketest

The "smoketest" testplan has about 20 tests that exercise a
variety of features on a board.  After running these commands, a
set of jobs will appear in the Jenkins interface.

Once this is done, your Jenkins interface should look something
like this:

[[image:fuego-1.1-jenkins-dashboard-beaglebone-jobs.png|width=900]]



Run a test
==========
To run a job manually, you can do the following:
* Go to the Jenkins dashboard (in the main Jenkins web page),
* Select the job (which includes the board name and the test name)
* Click “Build job”  (Jenkins refers to running a test as "building" it.)

You can also click on the circle with a green triangle, on the far right
of the line with the job name, in the Jenkins dashboard.

When the test has completed, the status will be shown by a colored ball
to the side of the test in the dashboard.  Blue means success, red means
failure, and grey means the test did not complete (was not run or
was aborted).  You can get details about the test run by clicking on
the link in the history list.

Additional Notes
================
Other variables in the board file
---------------------------------
Depending on the test you want to run, you may need to define some other
variables that are specific to your board or the configuration of the
filesystem on it.  Please see [[Adding a board]] for detailed instructions
and a full list of variables that may be used on the target.

The Jenkins interface
---------------------
See [[Jenkins User Interface]] for more screenshots of the Jenkins
web interface.  This will help familiarize you with some of the features
of Jenkins, if you are new to using this tool.
